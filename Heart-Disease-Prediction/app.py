        ### üåü About This Application
        The Health Assistant uses a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease 
        based on various health indicators (e.g., age, cholesterol, blood pressure). 
        It provides insights for individuals and healthcare professionals.

        ### üîâ Important
        This tool provides **preliminary insights** only. It is **not** a substitute for professional medical advice. Always consult a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis.

        ### ‚ù§Ô∏è What is Heart Disease?
        Heart disease refers to a range of conditions that affect the heart, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmia, and others. The most common cause of heart disease is atherosclerosis (narrowing of the blood vessels due to a build-up of fatty deposits). 

        #### Risk Factors:
        - High blood pressure
        - High cholesterol
        - Smoking
        - Diabetes
        - Family history of heart disease
        - Sedentary lifestyle
        - Obesity
        - Poor diet

        #### Preventive Measures:
        - Maintain a healthy diet with less saturated fat, sugar, and salt.
        - Regular physical activity (at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise per day).
        - Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption.
        - Monitor blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels.
        - Manage stress through relaxation techniques like yoga or meditation.

        ### üìà Prediction Insights
        This app will help assess the likelihood of heart disease based on your medical data. If you receive a positive prediction, it is essential to follow up with a healthcare provider for proper diagnostic tests like ECG, cholesterol screening, and stress tests.
